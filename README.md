This project required me to take on the role of an analyst for an existing company, Instacart, an online grocery store that operates
through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more
information about their sales patterns. My task was to perform an initial data and exploratory
analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better
segmentation and marketing. 

## Objective
The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database
along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same
methods, and they’re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different
customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale
of their products. My analysis focuses on showing what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacart
targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products. 

**The stakeholders would like to be able to answer the following key questions:**

**1) The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day
are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times
when there are fewer orders.**

**2) They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend
the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.**

**3) Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use
simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.**

**4) Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product
orders.**

**5) The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of
customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:**

**a) What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how
often do they return to Instacart)?**

**b) Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?**

**c) Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?**

**d) Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?**

**6) What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age?
Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?**

**7) What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles?
Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are
ordering, and anything else you can think of.**
